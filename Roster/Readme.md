## NHL-view-name-change-guide by Krossbar Kenny

First, if you don't have it, download NHL View
http://www.artemkh.com/files/nhlview/nhlview.zip

Then, get the latest version of the .tdb file 

Rename "nhl2007.tdb" to "nhl2007PC.tdb" using BigGUI https://dl.fifa-infinity.com/fifa-09/biggui-tool/
and edit db.viv in NHLView


Next, click Open and this window comes up

make sure the top dropdown menu says Pick Manually 
Click on the button shown with the arrow, and select the tdb file you downloaded
Click Open

The top part of the screen should look like this

![image 02](https://i.imgur.com/st1JVQ6.png)

click the L. Name tab to sort in alphabetical order
Next, click the Teams tab (in red)

When you click on a team name, you get this screen

Next, click on the Lines tab (in red)

This glorious mess of a screen should appear:

Now, from here, your method may differ, but this is what I do:
First, I click on each player in black and click Scratch to remove everyone from the lineup.
Then, I click Overall to sort by overall rating

Now, I want to know if any of these guys is still active in the league, so I head over to Elite Prospects and enter their names in the search bar.
For example, Jarome Iginla

I can see from this page that he's retired, so he's safe to change or move
(actually, I'm going to move him to another team in case I want to make a superstar old-timers team)
Next on the list is Dion Phaneuf
https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/8564/dion-phaneuf

Now, he's on the LA Kings now, so I'm going to put him there.

Click the Transactions tab (in red)

![image 07](https://i.imgur.com/NprnvYs.png) 

1. Choose the two teams from the dropdown menus
2. Choose the player to move
Click the Move button
Click the Teams tab to return to the line-up screen
Repeat the process to see if any of the other players are still active in the game

(time passes)
Next, I want to see if there are any guys on the Calgary roster that are in the game ON OTHER TEAMS
So, I head over to their roster on Elite
https://www.eliteprospects.com/team/54/calgary-flames

Then click on the Players tab to view the players in the game

![image 09](https://i.imgur.com/GQGMAJv.png) 

remember when we sorted the players alphabetically?
That comes in handy now
We have to check the names on the roster to see if they're in the game by scrolling through the list
Now there is one thing to our advantage here.

The youngest player in the original game was born in 1989, so anyone born after 1990 (1990-20whatever) IS NOT IN THE GAME
So you only have to check players born before 1990
(a little more time passes)
On the team page on Elite, there is also a LINES tab you can click to see that teams current lines (fairly accurate)

In NHL View, I go back to the Team screen

![image 10](https://i.imgur.com/vB4JXkF.png) 

Next, let's start adding and editing players IN EARNEST
(finally, you might be saying :D)

1. Click on the position you wish to fill
2. DOUBLE-CLICK on the player you wish to fill it.
3. Click the Players tab to switch to the player edit screen

You should get this:

![image 11](https://i.imgur.com/Bg9BZyZ.png) 

You can edit a lot of stuff here, but I'm only going to change the name for now

![image 12](https://i.imgur.com/Gmc6NrN.png) 

before and after
Click on the Teams tab to go back to the line-up screen
If you don't see the change, don't worry. Click on another team, then back to the team you're working on, and it will show up
Do this for the rest of the players.

Save your file, rename this file back to "nhl2007.tdb" using BigGUI https://dl.fifa-infinity.com/fifa-09/biggui-tool/

then rebuild the into the iso with umdgen https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/1218/ 

and rebuild the iso
