## Important Notes
- Do not fast forward or speed up the game speed during the loading of a multiplayer game, it will cause desyncing and mess up the game.
- If you are on PSP or PS Vita, ensure you are properly connected to the right DNS 
- Both Modded and Vanilla work work online, but games will only work if both players have the same version 
- Playing multiplayer from cross platform may not work (for example, One user on PC and another on android) 
- Ensure all users have the same PPSSPP version, having different versions may cause issues 
- And lastly, have fun!
