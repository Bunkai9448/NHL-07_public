## Various Roster files

To apply a roster, copy the ulus folder inside your PSP's savedata folder. If you have a previous save, rename it, so you don't lose it. Check [SaveData](https://github.com/Bunkai9448/NHL-07_public/tree/main/SaveData) if you need more info on those. (Rosters are shared in the discord due to space and management reasons).
