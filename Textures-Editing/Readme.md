Load .msh files, not .viv files, in Console Texture Explorer.
First, you need to extract the files from jerseys.viv through bigGUI. Then, load as ini file, either "fe-JERS_XXX_0X.ini" or "gamedata-uniXXX_X.ini". The first one is for the torfs and the second one for the in-game jerseys.

There are two jerseys.viv files, one in the fe folder (torfs) and the second one in the gamedata folder (in-game jerseys).
