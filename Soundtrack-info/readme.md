## To convert the aud songs into mp3

See the [aud.to.mp3.bat](https://github.com/Bunkai9448/NHL-07_public/blob/main/Soundtrack-info/aud.to.mp3.bat) file of this folder for a Proof of Concept. \
\
In addition to the bat file, you'll need the following:

- https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html
- https://www.pspunk.com/psp-atrac3/
- https://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm
- [converter.bms](https://github.com/Bunkai9448/NHL-07_public/blob/main/Soundtrack-info/converter.bms) (this file was taken from the now closed forum Xentax)
- [msvcr71.dll](https://es.dll-files.com/msvcr71.dll.html) 

And your folder tree should look like this:
```
aud.to.mp3/
|   aud.to.mp3.bat
|   yourFile.aud
|
\---tools.required/
    |   at3tool.exe
    |   converter.bms
    |   ffmpeg.exe
    |   msvcr71.dll
    |   quickbms.exe
    \
```
